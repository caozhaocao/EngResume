# Project Experience #

### 1. Communication model calibration    
Time：2016.8 — 2016.9    
Language/ Framework：C#/WinForm    
Description: Added a peripheral site calibration model in the applications on the CBB platform, could have a random switching options with original neighboring calibration model.      
1)The original calibration model could not accurately reflect the data, so add the peripheral site calibration model;    
2)Frontline staff and testers coild choose different calibration models to obtain accurate data based on different scenarios.          
Responsibility: fulfilled the functional requirements at the requests of customers       
1)Independently completed the original neighborhood calibration model program, added the peripheral site calibration model, and could make the switch to change in XML;    
2)The output log of two calibration models were consistent with the expected ones, and did a good job in the unit test of codes.   

### 2.Detection of large data analysis of industrial Internet   
Time：2015.10 — 2016.6   
Language/ Framework：C#/WinForm    
Description: Inspected large data analysis of the Internet industry, ensured security and confidentiality, and set the Hierarchical permission setting of data, established an application platform with a set of data storage, processing, statistics analysis and security.     
1)Cooperated with the southern detection, FTC laboratory, ECME, CMMSG EC department;   
2)Did the distributed storage, cleaning, conversion, processing and analysis, knowledge expression of the structure data of mobile phones (including hardware test data, APP application software testing data, sales data), and gave the feedback to all departments in a visual form,Planned follow-up data to extend to documents, videos, voices.       
Responsibility:   
1)Preliminarily report direction of planned lab test data mining direction and assigned tasks;   
2)Completed a virtual machine in Azure platform and built Hadoop and HBase framework.    

### 3. Mobile phone cost-effective tool   
Time：2015.4 — 2015.7    
Language/ Framework：C#/WinForm/Web   
Description: according to the requirements of the product department, designed mobile phone cost-effective ranking tool.      
1)Made a mobile phone cost-effective tool ranking tool like An Tutu, 360 Paofenwang and Master Lu;   
2)Not familiar with software, needed to manually scored and weighted the mobile phone parts.               
Responsibility:     
1)Assisted the product department to complete the demand analysis and completed the UML;     
2)Independently completed all tasks development and unit testing;      
3)Wrote mobile phone cost-effective report and development documents.    

### 4. E-commerce information management system     
Time：2015.3 — 2015.7      
Language/ Framework：C#/WinForm/Web       
Description: the system included two modules: morning meeting KPI task plan and backstage management system of mobile phone information 
1)Morning meeting mainly included the plan and mission of the today and KPI completion condition of yesterday;    
2)The background management system of mobile phone information provided complete data for the marketing department and product department.    
Responsibility:   
1)Responsible for the development and testing of the background management system module of the mobile phone information, assisting colleagues to improve the functions;   
2)MVC three layer framework mainly involved the Model layer, had the basic operation like addition, modification and deletion in the database;     
3)Replaced the maintenance difficulty, resource consumption and other optimization caused by the stored procedure and trigger by events; 
4)Applied locks and indexes to improve performance, reduced latency and increased work efficiency.     

### 5. Three rights certification and geographic national census      
Time：2013.6 — 2014.4      
Language/ Framework：C#//AutoCAD/ArcGis
